Chapter 2
=========

I planned to follow along using different programming languages.
After starting out with Rust, Lua, Python and, of course, Scheme I find that
Rust and Lua are not ideal for the first part (the combinator language).

Rust does not have a notion of variable arity or multiple return values but its
type system automatically makes sure that only valid arguments can be passed
between functions. While it's possible to implement a dynamic value system and
function call protocol, one would lose many of Rust's advantages while writing
rather non-idiomatic code. Rust's static type system requires most likely a
different approach to combinators than the one taken in the book.

Lua is in spirit relatively close to Scheme (it guarantees tail calls!), and it
supports even variable argument functions and multiple return values. However,
it lacks introspection into function arity, which the combinators rely upon.

This leaves Scheme and Python in the race. Python does not have multiple return
values, but this can be worked around I think...  

Exercise 2.1
------------
- [Scheme implementation](https://github.com/mbillingr/sdf/commit/55305f7499b21264e12fd37c97bad0d8fffb5324)
- [Python implementation](https://github.com/mbillingr/sdf/commit/1aa44e739f436208d78350ed55ce76d2297fe21f)

Exercise 2.2
------------
- [Scheme and Python](https://github.com/mbillingr/sdf/commit/d3080e0d3ebdb8aa7dab5f9cce4e08991390072f)


Exercise 2.7
------------
a) (r:repeat 0 1 x) calls (r:alt x "").

b) In terms of data, Alyssa's proposal (xxx|xxxx|xxxxx) duplicates the prefix of
   each repetition.  This could lead to very long patterns. Eva's proposal
   (xxxx?x?) creates a much more concise pattern representation.
   In terms of code, Alyssa's proposal would require a rather blunt new
   algorithm that repeats the pattern MIN to MAX times, and would result in a
   complete rewrite of r:repeat. Eva's proposal could be implemented with very
   little change to the existing code.
   Regarding both code and data, Alyssa's proposal is O(NÂ²) while Eva's is O(N).

c) Ben's proposal can be implemented in terms of BREs, while the other proposals
   are only valid in ERE. This proposal requires no repetition of the expression
   in the pattern at all. Interval patterns are a straight forward translation
   of r:repeat semantics.

d) In the code...
